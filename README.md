ValidationEditText
==================
ValidationEditText is inheritanced by editText. It can be useful to validate input data and to notify error message. 

You already know way to notify error messages(using showError() function) on editText. I think however, design of default error message is not good to view. But, ValidationEditText provide powerful way to design error message.
